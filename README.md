## GOAL

After receiving multiple fines because I didn't react fast enough to the 
6-day deadline applied in Paris for parking lots. I came up with the idea of
this little program to get around this rule by taking care of paying my
parking fees for me.

I would never thank this rule which makes no sense for an honest resident.

One can say that this tool has cost me so much in fines that it is hard to
believe that it could ever be profitable for me.

Hoping to avoid this ordeal to others.
